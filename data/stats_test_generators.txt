Fully random test:
Average result = 2.20000
Average number of different coins used = 2.00000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 1.38782%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 42.23397%

Random test with smaller coins:
Average result = 8.00000
Average number of different coins used = 3.20000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 4.05800%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 18.20171%

Small rests modulo:
Average result = 101.30000
Average number of different coins used = 2.50000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 6.93973%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 40.74591%

Difficult rests modulo:
Average result = 8.10000
Average number of different coins used = 3.40000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 1.47251%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 3.31151%
