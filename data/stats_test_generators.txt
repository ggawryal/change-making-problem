Fully random test:
Average result = 2.20000
Average number of different coins used = 2.00000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 1.38782%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 42.23397%

Random test with smaller coins:
Average result = 8.30000
Average number of different coins used = 3.00000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 3.25743%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 19.95013%

Small rests modulo:
Average result = 25.00000
Average number of different coins used = 2.90000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 1.67162%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 16.32216%

Difficult rests modulo:
Average result = 8.30000
Average number of different coins used = 3.50000
Average percentage of targets for which greedy works = 1.67934%
Average percentage of targets for which result changes after removing 10% of coins = 15.28307%
